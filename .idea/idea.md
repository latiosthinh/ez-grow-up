think of an web base app which help kids from 2-6 learn to read - english and vietnamese.
we have like learn letters, divided into 7-8 groups of letters.
app will work like this:
- we have a place holder for every letters on the left side of the screen
- each letter will be like wooden toy, lie on the right side of the screen
- kids can touch/click the toy, the toy keep repeat sounding its letter's pronunciation
- kids drag the letter to the according placeholder, the sound will repeat faster, and the border of the placeholder will be like blinking.
- when kids drag letter into correct place, the sound will stop, and the border of the placeholder will stop blinking.
- level will complete if all the letters go to it correcting placeholder.
- next level will show more letters (from 1 to 4)
- 2 year-old will just only learn letters and numbers
- from 3 year-old, kids will learn the simple words with topics
- from 5 year-old, kids will drag and drop the words into simple sentences with topics
